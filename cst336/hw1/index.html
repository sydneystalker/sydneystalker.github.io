            <h1>Introduction to Cybersecurity</h1>

            <p> Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, networks, and data from malicious attacks. 
            It focuses on keeping information secure from theft, damage, or disruption caused by hackers or harmful software. 
            As our personal and professional lives increasingly depend on technology, cybersecurity plays a vital role in
             protecting sensitive information and maintaining trust in digital systems.</p>

            <p> Everyday activities—like online shopping, banking, and social media—rely on secure connections to protect personal data. 
            Cybersecurity professionals work to identify risks, strengthen systems, and respond to threats quickly when attacks occur. 
            Their goal is to ensure that information remains confidential, accurate, and accessible only to those authorized to use it.</p>

            <p> Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. 
            Whether it’s individuals updating their devices, companies using firewalls, or governments creating security policies, 
            everyone contributes to a safer online environment. 
            Understanding basic security practices helps reduce the risk of cybercrime and supports a more resilient digital world.</p>
