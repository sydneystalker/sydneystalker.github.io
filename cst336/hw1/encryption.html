            <h1>Encryption and Data Protection</h1>

            <p>Encryption is one of the most effective ways to secure sensitive data. 
            It works by converting readable information, called plaintext, into coded data that can only be understood by someone who has the correct key to decrypt it. 
            According to the <a href="https://www.security.uci.edu/how-to/encryption" target="_blank">University of California, Irvine</a>, 
            encryption helps protect personal files, emails, and financial data from unauthorized access—especially when information is shared or stored online.</p>

            <blockquote>
            "Encryption is not only a best practice but a requirement in many industries that handle confidential data. 
            By encrypting sensitive files, organizations can reduce the risk of data breaches and maintain compliance with privacy regulations."
            <br>– UC Irvine Information Security Office
            </blockquote>

            <p>Encryption is used everywhere, from securing your online banking sessions to protecting medical records and personal communications. 
            There are two main types: <em>symmetric encryption</em>, which uses one key for both encrypting and decrypting data, 
            and <em>asymmetric encryption</em>, which uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. 
            Together, these methods keep digital communication private and trustworthy.</p>

            <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
            <p>Many websites that begin with <strong>HTTPS</strong> use encryption to protect your information while it travels across the internet. 
            The “S” in HTTPS stands for “secure.” Always look for this in your browser’s address bar before entering passwords or payment information.</p>
            </div>

            <p>In today’s connected world, encryption isn’t just for large organizations—it’s essential for everyone. 
            By understanding how data protection works, users can make smarter choices to keep their personal information safe and private.</p>
