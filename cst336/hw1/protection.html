            <h1>Protecting Yourself Online</h1>

            <p>As we spend more of our lives online, protecting personal information has become more important than ever. 
            Cybercriminals often take advantage of weak passwords, unsafe browsing habits, and outdated software to steal data or access accounts. 
            Good cybersecurity practices start with awareness and a few simple habits that anyone can follow.</p>

            <p>One of the most effective ways to improve your online security is by creating strong, unique passwords. 
            According to <a href="https://www.manufacturing.net/industry40/blog/22262886/cybersecurity-101-creating-stronger-passwords" target="_blank">Manufacturing.net</a>, stronger passwords make it harder for hackers to break into your accounts, even with advanced tools or guessing software.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Stronger Passwords</h2>

            <table border="1" cellpadding="10">
            <tr>
                <th>Best Practice</th>
                <th>Explanation</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Use long passwords</strong></td>
                <td>Longer passwords are harder to crack. Aim for at least 12–16 characters using a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Avoid personal information</strong></td>
                <td>Do not include easily guessed details like your name, birthday, or pet’s name.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Use passphrases</strong></td>
                <td>Create passwords from random words or a memorable sentence rather than a single word.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong></td>
                <td>Adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Use a password manager</strong></td>
                <td>Securely stores and generates complex passwords so you don’t have to remember each one individually.</td>
            </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Practicing good password hygiene and staying alert to suspicious emails, links, and websites can greatly reduce your risk of becoming a target of cyberattacks. 
            Cybersecurity begins with simple daily habits that keep your information safe.</p>

            <h2>Additional Ways to Stay Safe Online</h2>

            <p>Strong passwords are only one part of staying secure online. 
            According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2021/06/10/cybersecurity-and-your-computer/" target="_blank">Forbes Tech Council</a>, 
            protecting your computer also involves updating your software regularly, recognizing suspicious activity, and taking advantage of built-in security features. 
            Simple habits can make a big difference in keeping your devices and data safe.</p>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep your software updated:</strong> Regularly installing updates ensures that security vulnerabilities are patched. 
            Many cyberattacks target outdated systems that are missing critical fixes.</li>

            <li><strong>Use antivirus and firewall protection:</strong> A reliable antivirus program and an active firewall help detect and block malicious software before it can cause damage.</li>

            <li><strong>Be cautious with public Wi-Fi:</strong> Avoid accessing sensitive information, such as bank accounts, while on public networks. 
            If necessary, use a virtual private network (VPN) for secure connections.</li>

            <li><strong>Think before clicking:</strong> Be careful with links or attachments in unexpected emails. 
            Even if a message looks official, verify the source before clicking or downloading anything.</li>

            <li><strong>Back up important data:</strong> Store copies of essential files on an external drive or secure cloud service. 
            Backups can help you recover quickly if your device is compromised.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Practicing these habits helps create a strong personal security foundation. 
            Cybersecurity isn’t just about having the right software—it’s about making smart, consistent choices whenever you go online.</p>
