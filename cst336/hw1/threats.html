            <h1>Common Cyber Threats</h1>

            <p>Cyber threats are malicious activities designed to damage, disrupt, 
            or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data. </p>

            <p>Understanding the most common types of cyberattacks helps individuals and 
            organizations recognize potential risks and take steps to stay safe online.</p>

            <p>Below are some of the most frequent and dangerous forms of cyber threats:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> One of the most common types of cyberattacks, phishing occurs when criminals send emails, 
                    messages, or pop-ups that appear legitimate but are designed to trick users into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. According to <a href="https://www.staysafeonline.org/articles/phishing" target="_blank">StaySafeOnline.org</a>, 
                    phishing scams often create a sense of urgency or fear to prompt users to click malicious links.</li>

                <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Short for “malicious software,” malware includes viruses, worms, spyware, and ransomware. 
                    It can damage files, steal information, or even lock users out of their own devices until a ransom is paid.</li>

                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> This type of attack encrypts the victim’s data and demands payment to restore access. 
                    It can affect individuals, businesses, and even government agencies.</li>

                <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Attackers use psychological manipulation to trick people into 
                    revealing confidential information or performing unsafe actions, 
                    such as opening a harmful attachment or transferring funds.</li>

                <li><strong>Password Attacks:</strong> Hackers attempt to guess or steal user passwords through methods like brute force attacks, 
                    where automated systems test countless password combinations until they find the right one.</li>

                <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> These overwhelm a network or website with excessive traffic,
                     making it temporarily unavailable to legitimate users.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These cyber threats are constantly evolving, but awareness and good digital habits can significantly reduce the risk of becoming a victim.</p>
